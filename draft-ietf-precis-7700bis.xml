  <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">

    <section title="Overview" anchor="overview">
      <t>A number of technologies and applications provide the ability for a person to choose a memorable, human-friendly name in a communications context, or to set such a name for another entity such as a device, account, contact, or website.  Such names are variously called "nicknames" (e.g., in chat room applications), "display names" (e.g., in Internet mail), or "petnames" (see <xref target='PETNAME-SYSTEMS'/>); for consistency, these are all called "nicknames" in this document.</t>
      <t>Nicknames are commonly supported in technologies for textual chat rooms, e.g., Internet Relay Chat <xref target='RFC2811'/> and multi-party chat technologies based on the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) <xref target='RFC6120'/> <xref target='XEP-0045'/>, the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) <xref target='RFC4975'/> <xref target='RFC7701'/>, and Centralized Conferencing (XCON) <xref target='RFC5239'/> <xref target='XCON-SYSTEM'/>.  Recent chat room technologies also allow internationalized nicknames because they support code points from outside the ASCII range <xref target='RFC20'/>, typically by means of the Unicode coded character set <xref target='Unicode'/>.  Although such nicknames tend to be used primarily for display purposes, they are sometimes used for programmatic purposes as well (e.g., kicking users or avoiding nickname conflicts).</t>
      <t>A similar usage enables a person to set their own preferred display name or to set a preferred display name for another user (e.g., the "display-name" construct in the Internet message format <xref target='RFC5322'/> and <xref target='XEP-0172'/> in XMPP).</t>
      <t>Memorable, human-friendly names are also used in contexts other than personal messaging, such as names for devices (e.g., in a network visualization application), websites (e.g., for bookmarks in a web browser), accounts (e.g., in a web interface for a list of payees in a bank account), people (e.g., in a contact list application), and the like.</t>
      <t>The rules specified in this document can be applied in all of the foregoing contexts.</t>
      <t>To increase the likelihood that memorable, human-friendly names will work in ways that make sense for typical users throughout the world, this document defines rules for preparing, enforcing, and comparing internationalized nicknames.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology" anchor="terms">
      <t>Many important terms used in this document are defined in <xref target='I-D.ietf-precis-7564bis'/>, <xref target='RFC6365'/>, and <xref target='Unicode'/>.</t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.</t>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section title='Nickname Profile' anchor='rules'>

    <section title='Rules' anchor='rules-rules'>
      <t>The following rules apply within the Nickname profile of the PRECIS FreeformClass defined in the PRECIS framework specification <xref target='I-D.ietf-precis-7564bis'/>.</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Width Mapping Rule: There is no width-mapping rule (such a rule is not necessary because width mapping is performed as part of normalization using Normalization Form KC (NFKC) as specified below).</t>
          <t>Additional Mapping Rule: The additional mapping rule consists of the following sub-rules.
            <list>
              <t>Map any instances of non-ASCII space to ASCII space (U+0020); a non-ASCII space is any Unicode code point having a general category of "Zs", naturally with the exception of U+0020.  (The inclusion of only ASCII space prevents confusion with various non-ASCII space code points, many of which are difficult to reproduce across different input methods.)</t>
              <t>Remove any instances of the ASCII space character at the beginning or end of a nickname (e.g., "stpeter&#160;" is mapped to "stpeter").</t>
              <t>Map interior sequences of more than one ASCII space character to a single ASCII space character (e.g., "St&#160;&#160;Peter" is mapped to "St&#160;Peter").</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>Case Mapping Rule: Apply the Unicode toLower() operation, as defined in the Unicode Standard <xref target='Unicode'/>.  In applications that prohibit conflicting nicknames, this rule helps to reduce the possibility of confusion by ensuring that nicknames differing only by case (e.g., "stpeter" vs. "StPeter") would not be presented to a human user at the same time.  (As explained below, this is typically appropriate only for comparison, not for enforcement.)</t>
          <t>Normalization Rule: Apply Unicode Normalization Form KC.  Because NFKC is more "aggressive" in finding matches than other normalization forms (in the terminology of Unicode, it performs both canonical and compatibility decomposition before recomposing code points), this rule helps to reduce the possibility of confusion by increasing the number of code points that would match (e.g., U+2163 ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR would match the combination of U+0049 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I and U+0056 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER V).</t>
          <t>Directionality Rule: There is no directionality rule. The "Bidi Rule" (defined in <xref target='RFC5893'/>) and similar rules are unnecessary and inapplicable to nicknames, because it is perfectly acceptable for a given nickname to be presented differently in different layout systems (e.g., a user interface that is configured to handle primarily a right-to-left script versus an interface that is configured to handle primarily a left-to-right script), as long as the presentation is consistent in any given layout system.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Preparation' anchor='rules-prep'>
      <t>An entity that prepares a string for subsequent enforcement according to this profile MUST ensure that the string consists only of Unicode code points that conform to the FreeformClass string class defined in <xref target='I-D.ietf-precis-7564bis'/>.</t>
    </section>


    <section title='Enforcement' anchor='rules-enforce'>
<t>An entity that performs enforcement according to this profile MUST prepare a string as described in <xref target='rules-prep'/> and MUST also apply the following rules specified in <xref target='rules-rules'/> in the order shown:
<list style="numbers">
<?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
<t>Additional Mapping Rule</t>
<t>Normalization Rule</t>
</list></t>
<?rfc subcompact="no"?>
<t>Note: An entity SHOULD NOT apply the Case Mapping Rule during enforcement, because typically it is appropriate only during comparison.</t>
<t>After all of the foregoing rules have been enforced, the entity MUST
  ensure that the nickname is not zero bytes in length (this is done
  after enforcing the rules to prevent applications from mistakenly
  omitting a nickname entirely, because when internationalized
  strings are accepted, a non-empty sequence of characters can
  result in a zero-length nickname after canonicalization).</t>
</section>

    <section title="Comparison" anchor="rules-comp">
<t>  An entity that performs comparison of two strings according to this
  profile MUST prepare each string as specified in <xref target='rules-prep'/> and
  MUST apply the following rules specified in <xref target='rules-rules'/> in the order
  shown:
<?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Additional Mapping Rule</t>
<t>Case Mapping Rule</t>
<t>Normalization Rule</t>
</list></t>
<?rfc subcompact="no"?>
<t>The two strings are to be considered equivalent if and only if they are an exact
  octet-for-octet match (sometimes called "bit-string identity").
</t>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section title="Examples" anchor="examples">
    <t>The following examples illustrate a small number of nicknames that are consistent with the format defined above, along with the output string resulting from application of the PRECIS rules (note that the characters &lt; and &gt; are used to delineate the actual nickname and are not part of the nickname strings).</t>

    <t>Regarding examples 5, 6, and 7: applying the Unicode toLower() operation
  to GREEK CAPITAL LETTER SIGMA (U+03A3) results in GREEK SMALL LETTER
  SIGMA (U+03C3), however the toLower() operation does not modify GREEK SMALL 
  LETTER FINAL SIGMA (U+03C2); therefore, the comparison operation defined in
  <xref target="rules-comp"/> would result in matching of the nicknames in 
  examples 5 and 6 but not the nicknames in examples 5 and 7 or 6 and 7.


    Regarding example 8: symbol characters such as BLACK CHESS KING
    (U+265A) are allowed by the PRECIS FreeformClass and thus can be
    used in nicknames.  Regarding example 9: applying the Unicode 
    toLower() operation to ROMAN NUMERAL FOUR (U+2163) results in SMALL ROMAN
    NUMERAL FOUR (U+2173), and applying NFKC to SMALL ROMAN NUMERAL
    FOUR (U+2173) results in LATIN SMALL LETTER I (U+0069) LATIN SMALL
    LETTER V (U+0086).</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Use in Application Protocols" anchor="use">
    <t>This specification defines only the PRECIS-based rules for handling of nickname strings.  It is the responsibility of an application protocol (e.g., MSRP, XCON, or XMPP) or application definition to specify the protocol slots in which nickname strings can appear, the entities that are expected to enforce the rules governing nickname strings, and when in protocol processing or interface handling the rules need to be enforced.  See Section 6 of <xref target='I-D.ietf-precis-7564bis'/> for guidelines about using PRECIS profiles in applications.</t>
    <t>Above and beyond the PRECIS-based rules specified here, application protocols can also define application-specific rules governing nickname strings (rules regarding the minimum or maximum length of nicknames, further restrictions on allowable code points or character ranges, safeguards to mitigate the effects of visually similar characters, etc.).</t>
    <t>Naturally, application protocols can also specify rules governing the actual use of nicknames in applications (reserved nicknames, authorization requirements for using nicknames, whether certain nicknames can be prohibited, handling of duplicates, the relationship between nicknames and underlying identifiers such as SIP URIs or Jabber IDs, etc.).</t>
    <t>Entities that enforce the rules specified in this document are encouraged to be liberal in what they accept by following this procedure:</t>
    <t>
      <list style='numbers'>
        <t>Where possible, map characters (e.g, through width mapping, additional mapping, case mapping, or normalization) and accept the mapped string.</t>
        <t>If mapping is not possible (e.g., because a character is disallowed in the FreeformClass), reject the string.</t>
      </list>
    </t>
    <t>Implementation experience has shown that applying the rules for the Nickname profile is not an idempotent procedure for all code points. Therefore, implementations might need to apply the rules more than once to a nickname string.</t>

<abstract><t>Application protocols using Unicode characters in protocol strings need to properly handle such strings in order to enforce internationalization rules for strings placed in various protocol slots (such as addresses and identifiers) and to perform valid comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or authorization).  This document defines a framework enabling application protocols to perform the preparation, enforcement, and comparison of internationalized strings ("PRECIS") in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode characters and thus is agile with respect to versions of Unicode.  As a result, this framework provides a more sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings than the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454).  This document obsoletes RFC 7564.</t></abstract>
