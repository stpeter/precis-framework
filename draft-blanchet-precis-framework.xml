    <abstract>
      <t>Application protocols that make use of Unicode code points in protocol strings need to prepare such strings in order to perform comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or authorization).  In general, this problem has been labeled the "preparation and comparison of internationalized strings" or "PRECIS".  This document defines a framework that enables application protocols to prepare various classes of strings in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode code points.  Because this framework does not depend on large tables of Unicode code points as in stringprep (RFC 3454), it is more agile with regard to changes in the underlying Unicode database and thus provides improved flexibility to application protocols.  A specification that reuses this framework either can directly use the base string classes defined in this document or can subclass the base string classes as needed.  This framework uses an approach similar to that of the revised internationalized domain names in applications (IDNA) technology (RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC 5893, RFC 5894) and thus adheres to the high-level design goals described in RFC 4690, albeit for non-IDNA technologies.  This document obsoletes RFC 3454.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" anchor='intro'>
      <t>A number of IETF application technologies use stringprep <xref target='RFC3454'/> as the basis for comparing protocol strings that contain Unicode characters or "code points" <xref target='UNICODE'/>.  Since the publication of <xref target='RFC3454'/> in 2002, the Internet community has gained much more experience with internationalization, some of it reflected in <xref target='RFC4690'/>.  In particular, the IETF's technology for internationalized domain names (IDNs) has changed significantly: IDNA2003 <xref target='RFC3490'/>, which was based on stringprep, has been superseded by IDNA2008 (<xref target='RFC5890'/>, <xref target='RFC5891'/>, <xref target='RFC5892'/>, <xref target='RFC5893'/>, <xref target='RFC5894'/>), which does not use stringprep.  This migration away from stringprep for internationalized domain names has prompted other "customers" of stringprep to consider new approaches to the preparation and comparison of internationalized strings ("PRECIS"), as described in <xref target='PROBLEM'/>.</t>
      <t>This document proposes a technical framework for a post-stringprep approach to the preparation and comparison of internationalized strings in application protocols.  The framework is based on several principles:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Define a small set of base string classes appropriate for common application protocol constructs such as usernames, passwords, and free-form identifiers.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>Define each base string class in terms of Unicode code points and their properties, specifying whether each code point or category of code points is valid, disallowed, or unassigned.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>Enable application protocols to subclass the base string classes.<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t>Mapping operations (e.g., case preservation or lowercasing, Unicode normalization, right-to-left characters) are the responsibility of application protocols, as was done for IDNA2008 via <xref target='RFC5895'/>.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>It is expected that this framework will yield the following benefits:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Application protocols will be more version-agile with regard to the Unicode database.</t>
          <t>Implementers will be able to share code point tables and software code across application protocols, most likely by means of code libraries.</t>
          <t>End users will be able to build more accurate expectations about the code points that are acceptable in various contexts.  Given this more uniform set of string classes, it is also expected that copy/paste operations between software implementing different application protocols will be more predictable and coherent.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>Although this framework is similar to IDNA2008, it defines additional string classes to meet the needs of common application protocols.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology" anchor="terms">
      <t>Many important terms used in this document are defined in <xref target='PROBLEM'/>, <xref target='I18N-TERMS'/>, <xref target='RFC5890'/>, and <xref target='UNICODE'/>.</t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='RFC2119'/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="String Classes" anchor='classes'>
      <t>IDNA2008 essentially defines a base string class of internationalized domain name, although it does not use the term "string class".  (This document does not redefine a string class for domain names, and application protocols are strongly encouraged to IDNA2008 as the appropriate method to prepare domain names and hostnames.)</t>
      <t>We propose the following additional base string classes for use in application protocols:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='hanging'>
          <t hangText="Nameything:">a word or set of words that is used to identify or address a network entity such as a user, an account, a venue (e.g., a chatroom), an information source (e.g., a data feed), or a collection of data (e.g., a file).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t hangText="Wordything:">a sequence of letters, numbers, and symbols that is used as a secret for access to some resource on a network (e.g., a password or passphrase).<vspace blankLines='1'/></t>
          <t hangText="Stringything:">a sequence of letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, and other code points that is used for more expressive purposes in an application protocol (e.g., a nickname in a chatroom).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The following subsections discuss these string classes in more detail, with reference to the dimensions described in Section 3 of <xref target='PROBLEM'/>.</t>
      <t>Each string class is defined by the following behavioral rules:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='hanging'>
          <t hangText='Valid:'>defines which code points and code point categories are treated as valid input to preparation of the string.</t>
          <t hangText='Disallowed:'>defines which code points and code point categories are treated as disallowed during preparation of the string.</t>
          <t hangText='Unassigned:'>defines application behavior in the presence of code points that are unassigned, i.e. unknown for the version of Unicode the application is built upon.</t>
          <t hangText='Directionality:'>defines application behavior in the presence of code points that have directionality, in particular right-to-left code points as defined in the Unicode database (see <xref target='UAX9'/>.</t>
          <t hangText='Casemapping:'>defines if case mapping is used for this class, and how the mapping is done.</t>
          <t hangText='Normalization:'>defines which Unicode normalization form (D, KD, C, or KC) is to be applied (see <xref target='UAX15'/>).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>This document defines the valid, disallowed, and unassigned rules.  Application protocols that use the PRECIS string classes MUST define the directionality, casemapping, and normalization rules, as further described under <xref target='reuse'/>.</t>

Moreover, passwords are often carried by a sequence of protocols with backends such as RADIUS or LDAP.  Developers of application protocols are encouraged to look into reusing these profiles instead of defining new ones, so that expectations for passwords by end-users are consistent no matter what application protocol is used.</t>

    <section title="Code Point Properties">
      <t>In order to implement the string classes described above, this document does the following:</t>

        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Reviews and classifies the collections of code points in the Unicode character set by examining various properties of the code points.</t>
          <t>Defines an algorithm for determining a derived property value, which can vary depending on the string class being used by the relevant application protocol.</t>
         </list>
       </t>
       <t>NOTE: This document specifies a procedure that can be applied to code points, and not a table of code points, so that the algorithm can be used to determine code point sets independent of the version of Unicode that is in use.</t>
      <t>This document is not intended to specify precisely how derived property values are to be applied in protocol strings.  That information should be defined in the protocol specification that uses or subclasses a base string class from this document.</t>
      <t>The value of the property is to be interpreted as follows.</t> 
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>PROTOCOL VALID: Those that are allowed to be used in any PRECIS string class (nameything, wordything, and stringything).  Code points with this property value are permitted for general use in any string class.  The abbreviated term PVALID is used to refer to this value in the rest of this document.<vspace/></t>
          <t>SPECIFIC CLASS PROTOCOL VALID: Those that are allowed to be used in specific string classes. Code points with this property value are permitted for use in specific string classes.  In the rest of this document, the abbreviated term *_PVALID is used, where * = (NAMEY, WORDY, STRINGY).<vspace/></t>
          <t>CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED: Some characteristics of the character, such as it being invisible in certain contexts or problematic in others, requires that it not be used in labels unless specific other characters or properties are present.  The abbreviated term CONTEXT is used to refer to this value in the rest of this document.  There are two subdivisions of CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED, the first for Join_controls (called CONTEXTJ) and the second for other characters (called CONTEXTO).<vspace/></t>
          <t>DISALLOWED: Those that must not be included in any string class.  Code points with this property value are not permitted in any string class.<vspace/></t>
          <t>SPECIFIC CLASS DISALLOWED: Those that are not to be included in a specific string class.  Code points with this property value are not permitted in one of the string classes but might be permitted in others.  In the rest of this document, the abbreviated term *_DISALLOWED is used, where * = (NAMEY, WORDY, STRINGY).<vspace/></t>
          <t>UNASSIGNED: Those code points that are not designated (i.e. are unassigned) in the Unicode Standard.<vspace/></t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>The mechanisms described here allow determination of the value of the property for future versions of Unicode (including characters added after Unicode 5.2 or 6.0 depending on the category, since some categories in this document are re-used from IDNA2008).  Changes in Unicode properties that do not affect the outcome of this process do not affect this framework.  For example, a character can have its Unicode General_Category value <xref target='UNICODE'/> change from So to Sm, or from Lo to Ll, without affecting the algorithm results.  Moreover, even if such changes were to result, the <xref target="G">BackwardCompatible list</xref> can be adjusted to ensure the stability of the results.</t>
      <t>### OPEN ISSUE: How to handle a backward compatible list on the level of PRECIS string classes or sub-classes. ###</t>
      <t>Some code points need to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, but should be excluded in all other cases; these rules are also described in other documents.  The most notable of these are the Join Control characters, U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER.  Both of them have the derived property value CONTEXTJ.  A character with the derived property value CONTEXTJ or CONTEXTO (CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED) is not to be used unless an appropriate rule has been established and the context of the character is consistent with that rule.  It is invalid to generate a string containing these characters unless such a contextual rule is found and satisfied.  Please see Appendix A of <xref target='RFC5892'/> for more information.</t>

      <t>The derived property obtains its value based on a two-step procedure:</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>Characters are placed in one or more character categories based on either core properties defined by the Unicode Standard or by treating the code point as an exception and addressing the code point by its code point value.  These categories are not mutually exclusive.</t>
          <t>Set operations are used with these categories to determine the values for an string class specific property. These operations are specified under <xref target="PropertyCalculation" />.</t>

      <t>(NOTE: Unicode property names and property value names might have short abbreviations, such as gc for the General_Category property, and Ll for the Lowercase_Letter property value of the gc property.)</t>
      <t>In the following specification of categories, the operation which returns the value of a particular Unicode character property for a code point is designated by using the formal name of that property (from PropertyAliases.txt) followed by '(cp)'.  For example, the value of the General_Category property for a code point is indicated by General_Category(cp).</t>
      <t>The first ten categories (A-J) shown below were previously defined for IDNA2008 and are copied directly from <xref target='RFC5892'/>.

     <t>
	The grammatical rules are expressed in pseudo code. The conventions used
      for that pseudo code are explained here.
 </t>
 <t>
   Each rule is constructed as a Boolean expression that evaluates to
   either True or False. A simple "True;" or "False;" rule sets the
   default result value for the rule set. Subsequent conditional rules
   that evaluate to True or False may re-set the result value.
 </t>
 <t>
   A special value "Undefined" is used to deal with any error conditions,
    such as an attempt to test a character before the start of a label or
      after the end of a label. If any term of a rule evaluates to Undefined,
      further evaluation of the rule immediately terminates, as the result
      value of the rule will itself be Undefined.

		   A functional notation, Function_Name(cp), is used to express either
       string positions within a string, Boolean character property tests of a
       code point, or a regular expression match. When such function names
       refer to Boolean character property tests, the function names use the
       exact Unicode character property name for the property in question, and
       "cp" is evaluated as the Unicode value of the code point to be tested,
       rather than as its position in the string. When such function names
       refer to string positions within a string, "cp" is evaluated as its
       position in the string.
		 </t>
		 <t>
   RegExpMatch(X) takes as its parameter X a schematic regular expression
       consisting of a mix of Unicode character property values and literal
       Unicode code points.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   Script(cp) returns the value of the Unicode Script property, as defined
       in Scripts.txt in the Unicode Character Database.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   Canonical_Combining_Class(cp) returns the value of the Unicode
       Canonical_Combining_Class property, as defined in UnicodeData.txt in
       the Unicode Character Database.
	   </t>
		 <t>
		   Before(cp) returns the code point of the character immediately preceding
       cp in logical order in the string representing the string.
       Before(FirstChar) evaluates to Undefined.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   After(cp) returns the code point of the character immediately following
       cp in logical order in the string representing the string.
       After(LastChar) evaluates to Undefined.
		 </t>
		 <t>
			 Note that "Before" and "After" do not refer to the visual display order
       of the character in a string, which may be reversed or otherwise
       modified by the bidirectional algorithm for strings including characters
       from scripts written right-to-left. Instead,
			 'Before' and 'After' refer to the network order of the character in
			 the string.
		 </t>
		 <t>
			 The clauses "Then True" and "Then False" imply exit from the
       pseudo-code routine with the corresponding result.
		 </t>
		 <t>
		   Repeated evaluation for all characters in a string makes use of the
       special construct:
		 <list style="hanging">
		   <t><vspace/>
			   For All Characters:
			 <list style="hanging">
			   <t>
				   Expression;

			 </list>
			 </t>
			 <t>
			   End For;
       </t>
		 </list>
                 </t>
		 <t>
		   This construct requires repeated evaluation of "Expression" for each
       code point in the string, starting from FirstChar and proceeding to
       LastChar.
		 </t>
     <t>
       The different fields in the rules are to be interpreted as follows:
	<list style="hanging">
	<t hangText="Code point: "><vspace/>
	The code point, or code points, that this rule is to be applied to.

This document defines internationalized domain names (IDNs) and a mechanism called Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) for handling them in a standard fashion.  IDNs use characters drawn from a large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII characters to be represented using only the ASCII characters already allowed in so-called host names today.  This backward-compatible representation is required in existing protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no changes to the existing infrastructure.  IDNA is only meant for processing domain names, not free text. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract></front>

<t>Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication transform for IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and interpretations across all implementations, their assignment must be administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is provided by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).&lt;/t>&lt;t> In order for IANA to manage a given namespace prudently, it needs guidelines describing the conditions under which new values can be assigned or when modifications to existing values can be made. If IANA is expected to play a role in the management of a namespace, IANA must be given clear and concise instructions describing that role. This document discusses issues that should be considered in formulating a policy for assigning values to a namespace and provides guidelines for authors on the specific text that must be included in documents that place demands on IANA.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document obsoletes RFC 2434.

<t>The use of right-to-left scripts in Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) has presented several challenges.  This memo provides a new Bidi rule for Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) labels, based on the encountered problems with some scripts and some shortcomings in the 2003 IDNA Bidi criterion.

<abstract>
<t>Several years have passed since the original protocol for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) was completed and deployed.  During that time, a number of issues have arisen, including the need to update the system to deal with newer versions of Unicode.  Some of these issues require tuning of the existing protocols and the tables on which they depend.  This document provides an overview of a revised system and provides explanatory material for its components.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract></front>

<abstract>
<t>In the original version of the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) protocol, any Unicode code points taken from user input were mapped into a set of Unicode code points that "made sense", and then encoded and passed to the domain name system (DNS).  The IDNA2008 protocol (described in RFCs 5890, 5891, 5892, and 5893) presumes that the input to the protocol comes from a set of "permitted" code points, which it then encodes and passes to the DNS, but does not specify what to do with the result of user input.  This document describes the actions that can be taken by an implementation between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to the new IDNA protocol.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract></front>
